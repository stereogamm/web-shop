### This is a self-study project for creating an online store, where I used the following libraries:
- React v18
- React-router-dom v6
- React-redux 9
- Skeletonreact
- npm
- etc.

The project uses Webpack as a bundler. 
It implements frontend-backend interaction (using https://mockapi.io), as well as filtering mechanisms, pagination, and order creation.
