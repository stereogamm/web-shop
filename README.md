## 🍜 About the Project
Welcome to my project 'NOODLE & BYTES'. This is a self-study project for creating an online yammy store, where I used the following libraries:  
🍥 React v18  
🍥 React-router-dom v6  
🍥 React-redux 9  
🍥 Skeletonreact  
🍥 npm  
🍥 etc  
🉐 ...and a little bit of ramen magic. Let's get started!

🐲 The project uses Webpack as a bundler.  

⛩️ It implements frontend-backend interaction (using https://mockapi.io), as well as filtering mechanisms, pagination, and order creation.
